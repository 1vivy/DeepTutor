"""Snapshot data types.

An ``Entity`` is one unit of L1 content for a non-KB surface — e.g. one
notebook record, one co-writer document, one book, one chat session.
The snapshot is the *current* set of these on disk; the diff log records
how that set has changed across refreshes.

These types are intentionally pure dataclasses with no I/O. Adapters
build ``Entity`` lists; ``diff.diff_snapshots`` consumes two ``state``
dicts to produce ``ChangeEntry`` records.

    The diff compares fingerprints and carries labels for the change log; it
    never looks at ``content``. Building content anyway costs the chat surface
    ~7 MB of string concatenation per refresh (every message of every
    session), which is affordable for a user-initiated refresh and not
    affordable for an automatic one on every turn. A surface may therefore
    offer a *probe* that produces stamps directly; see
    :func:`~deeptutor.services.memory.snapshot.adapters.read_stamps`.

    A probe MUST derive ``id`` / ``label`` / ``fingerprint`` exactly as its
    full adapter does, or a probe-driven refresh and a content-driven one
    would disagree about what changed.

    ``ts`` takes no part in the diff — it rides along because "what happened
    recently" is a question worth answering without reading content either
    (the Tutor activity panel asks it on every load).
